### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/Revtrack
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install playwright beautifulsoup4 requests
   playwright install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Use

1. **Open the application** in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Enter an Amazon product URL** in the search box. For example:
   ```
   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW
   https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0D1TX35MQ
   ```

3. **Click "Analyze"** and wait for the scraping to complete (usually 30-60 seconds)

4. **View the results** which include:
   - Product details and images
   - Current pricing and discounts
   - Price history and trends
   - Customer review sentiment analysis
   - Pros and cons extracted from reviews
   - Key insights and recommendations

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/analyze`
Comprehensive product analysis endpoint that:
- Scrapes product data using `scripts/product.py`
- Analyzes reviews using `scripts/script2.py`
- Generates price history and insights
- Returns structured JSON with all analysis data

### `POST /api/scrape` (Legacy)
Basic scraping endpoint for reviews only.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Robust Web Scraping
- **Playwright Integration**: Handles JavaScript-heavy pages and bypasses basic anti-bot measures
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Implements exponential backoff and retry logic
- **User Agent Rotation**: Uses multiple user agents to avoid detection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues and rate limits

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis
- **Product Data**: Title, price, ratings, availability, features, images
- **Price Analysis**: Historical trends, lowest/highest prices, price direction
- **Review Sentiment**: Positive/negative/neutral sentiment analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python command not found**
   - Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed
   - The virtual environment is properly activated
   - Scripts use the virtual environment's Python path

2. **Playwright browser not found**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   playwright install
   ```

3. **Rate limiting issues**
   - Wait a few minutes between requests
   - The application includes automatic retry logic
   - Some Amazon regions have stricter rate limiting

4. **Build failures**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check that Python virtual environment is properly set up
   - Verify environment variables are correctly configured

### Performance Tips

- **First analysis** may take longer as browsers are initialized
- **Subsequent requests** are faster due to caching
- **Complex products** with many reviews take longer to analyze
- **Rate limiting** may slow down requests during peak hours
